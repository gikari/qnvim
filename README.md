# What's qnvim
qnvim helps those who are used to editing text in vim and also need Qt Creator features to combine these two.

It runs an instance of Neovim inside Qt Creator, so it's able to run your `init.vim` and all your vim plugins and your tweaks in `init.vim` should work.

# Status
It's in beta but it's mostly stable and usable, for last few months I've been using Qt Creator only with this plugin with no pain. Currently these are the known issues:
1. It doesn't support splits nor windows
1. It should use vim highlights for buffers that Qt Creator doesn't support. (like vim helpfiles and many others.)

All my 149 plugins installed in neovim work alright except a few that relate on highlights (Qt Creator highlights C++ and QML better than any vim plugin, so it's totally alright.) and those that rely on special buffers. (Work is in progress to handle all types of buffers.)

Please let me know if you find any problems and please contribute to this project if you have the time.

# Installation Instructions
1. Build Qt Creator from git repository (https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_Creator_from_Git)

If you build the head of master branch, then you can use qnvim only with your build, if you wanna use qnvim with the official release of Qt Creator you should checkout the tag that matches your installed Qt Creator.

1. Clone and compile https://github.com/equalsraf/neovim-qt
1. Install devel package of msgpack.
1. Open the `qnvim.pro` file as a project in your offical Qt Creator (not the one you built.)
1. Setup locations to Qt Creator build and neovim-qt in `qnvim.pro` file.
Like this:
```
isEmpty(IDE_SOURCE_TREE): IDE_SOURCE_TREE = "<PATH_TO_QT_CREATOR_CLONED_REPO>"
isEmpty(IDE_BUILD_TREE): IDE_BUILD_TREE = "<PATH_TO_QT_CREATOR_BUILD_DIRECTORY>"
INCLUDEPATH += <PATH_TO_NEOVIM_QT_SRC_DIRECTORY> <PATH_TO_MSGPACK_HEADERS>
LIBS += -L<PATH_TO_NEOVIM_QT_LIB_DIRECTORY> -lneovim-qt -lneovim-qt-gui -L<PATH_TO_MSG_PACK_LIB_DIRECTORY> -lmsgpackc
```
For example:
```
isEmpty(IDE_SOURCE_TREE): IDE_SOURCE_TREE = "/home_direcotry/packages/qt-creator"
isEmpty(IDE_BUILD_TREE): IDE_BUILD_TREE = "/home_direcotry/packages/qt-creator-build"
INCLUDEPATH += /home_direcotry/packages/neovim-qt/src /usr/local/Cellar/msgpack/2.1.5/include
LIBS += -L/home_direcotry/packages/neovim-qt/build/lib -lneovim-qt -lneovim-qt-gui -L/usr/local/Cellar/msgpack/2.1.5/lib -lmsgpackc
```

1. Setup locations to your Qt Creator build in Projects tab.
In the Qt Creator go to `Projects` Tab/Mode (you can select it in the left column) Active project should be `qnvim`, and in Build & Run `Desktop ...` should be selected. Under `Desktop ...` select `Run` and in the right side in the `Run` section set Executable to `<full path to>/qt-creator-build/bin/qtcreator` and working directory to `<full path to>/qt-creator-build/bin`

1. Build and run the project.

1. Put the built library in the location that Qt Creator expects plugins (it varies based on your OS) and use the built Qt Creator instead of the official version. (Or if you checked out the tag that corresponds to your installed Qt Creator, then you can use your own installed Qt Creator.)

## Updating

If you update your Qt Creator, you need to build qnvim against the version of Qt Creator you updated to. For example if you update from 4.8.0 to 4.9.0, you should go to the directory you clonned Qt Creator in, run `git fetch` followed by `git checkout <VERSION> --recurse`. Then you should go to the build directory of Qt Creator and **run `make clean`** and then build Qt Creator again. Then you should clean and build qnvim.

If you want to update qnvim, you just need to `git pull` in its directory and build it again, no need to do anything with Qt Creator build.

### Always run `make clean` before building anything after you upgrade Qt Creator

It's important to run `make clean` before building Qt Creator when it's upgraded, otherwise you'll end up with plugins with mismatching versions. (like this https://github.com/sassanh/qnvim/issues/8#issuecomment-485456543)

# `qnvim.vim`

You can put custom vim commands for your QtCreator environment in `qnvim.vim` which is a file in the same directory as `init.vim` (`:help $MYVIMRC`). `$MYQVIMRC` (note the `Q` after `MY`) is set to its path.

## Sample `qnvim.vim`

There's a sample `qnvim.vim` file available in the repo, it provides most of the convenient keyboard shortcuts for building, deplying, running, switching buffers, switching tabs, etc. It'll also help you understand how you can create new keyboard shortcuts using Qt Creator commands.
